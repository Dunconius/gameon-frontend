# Game Plan Coding Conventions

To keep our code clean, consistent, and easy to work with, here are our guidelines:

## Formatting

- **Indentation:** Use one tab for indentation.
- **Quotes:** Use double quotes for strings (e.g., `"Hello"`).

## Naming

- **Variables and Functions:** Use `camelCase` (e.g., `playerName`, `getEvents`).
- **Components:** Use `PascalCase` (e.g., `EventList`, `GameCard`).
- **Files:** Use `kebab-case` (e.g., `event-details.jsx`).

## Comments

- **Write clear comments:** Explain why you're doing something, not just what the code does.
- **Document components:** Briefly describe what each component does and its main props.

## Git Workflow

- **Branching:** Create new branches for features or bug fixes (e.g., `feature/new-event-form`, `fix/login-issue`).
- **Commit Messages:** Write short, descriptive messages (e.g., "fix(api): handle empty message in request body"). See cheatsheet here: [(https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13)]

## Tools

- **Prettier:** To auto-format code and keep it consistent.
- **ESLint:** To check for common errors and enforce coding style.

## Additional Notes

- We'll use American English spelling in all code, comments, and documentation.
- We'll be flexible and update these conventions as we develop as a team.
